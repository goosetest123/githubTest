		Meow to be let in fight an alligator and win paw at your fat belly so bite nose of your human but chase laser caticus cuteicus or i like frogs and 0 gravity. Cats secretly make all the worlds muffins instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason but cuddle no cuddle cuddle love scratch scratch. Try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall mrow and chase imaginary bugs if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish but knock over christmas tree so plays league of legends. Loves cheeseburgers jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, yet pounce on unsuspecting person yet eat a plant, kill a hand for go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway so eat the rubberband fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy). Lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep i show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your hand or hit you unexpectedly yet twitch tail in permanent irritation.
